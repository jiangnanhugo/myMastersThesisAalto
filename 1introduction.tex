** A picture is worth a thousand words, but how many can the machine say?**

Outlining the computer vision problem of labelling objects, how advent of CNN
has almost solved single object identification and to an extent multiple object
id and localization. With references ofcourse

More challenging problem is generating descriptive lables i.e captions
A precursor to the generic problem of machines understanding visual media.

\section{Problem statement}
Precisely describe the problem we are trying to solve here and all the
assumptions made in doing so.

Clearly outline the contributions and what the reader will get out of this
document. What are the different aspects of the problem we will address here,
how do we measure how well we are doing.
    - Basic Image captioning pipeline in detail
    - Then take apart each block and see how we can improve it
    - Then measure and demonstrate if these actually help
    - In depth analysis of  what are the strengths and weaknesses of current
    approaches
    - Put forth several ideas for what we could do next.
