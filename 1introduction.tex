\epigraph{A picture is worth a thousand words. But how many can the machine
say?}{Our adaption of an old English proverb}

\noindent The famous English adage states ``A picture is worth a thousand
words''.
%%
Translated into technical terms, this is meant to convey that there is a lot the
viewer can learn or infer from a single still image and that enumerating all the
information encoded in an image can take up to even a thousand words.
%%
This is illustrated in our extensive use of images in all forms of
communication, from scientific journals to Twitter chats. 
%
Humans are very good at processing images and videos and gathering all this
encoded information, but the computers still struggle to make sense of the
simplest ones.
%
One could say it is still easier for computers to store, parse, search and even
understand a thousand words than a single image.
%

The use of multimedia on the internet has grown to staggering levels in the
recent years, due to easy access to cameras in smart phones.
%%
For example about 95 million photos are uploaded to Instagram every
day~\cite{InstStats} and about 400 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube every
minute~\cite{YouStats}.
%
Rapidly growing amount of visual data being created due to this phenomenon
presents both an enormous challenge and an opportunity to build smarter
computer algorithms to understand and summarize the data.
%%
Such algorithms could help us index and search this visual data better.
%%
An algorithm which can learn to recognize and describe different objects and
their relationships in an image or a video would be an essential building block
of a general artificial intelligence~(AI) system.
%%
Hence, automatic understanding of visual media is an interesting and important
problem in many aspects of computer vision and AI.
%

An essential research topic at the heart of machine understanding of visual
media is automatic captioning of images and videos.
%%
This involves designing an algorithm which takes the image or the video as
input and generates a natural language caption succinctly describing the
content of the media.
%%
Effectively solving the above problem requires the machine to be able to
identify the salient objects in the image or video, recognize their attributes,
extract the relationships between these objects and also to correctly recognize
the scene.
%%
This machine also needs to be able to use the extracted information to generate
a natural language caption summarizing the essence of it.
%%
Since the caption generation requires both visual feature extraction and
natural language generation modules, it is also a good proxy task to measure
the progress in both these domains. 
%%

%%TODO: SHOULD THIS GO to literature review of features?
Until recently, the task of reliably identifying even a single object in an image
across diverse and large-scale datasets was hard.
%%
This changed dramatically with the availability of large-scale annotated data
such as the ImageNet dataset~\cite{ImagenetOrig}, and the application of deep
learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN).
%%
For example, in the image classification task of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual
Recognition Challenge~ (ILSVRC)~\cite{ILSVRC15}, which involves classifying
images to one of thousand object classes, the accuracy has improved from 71.8\%
to 95.06\%, surpassing the human performance on the same task. 
%%
It has also been discovered that image classification networks which are
trained on the large ImageNet dataset, also generalize very well and can be
used as generic image feature extraction for different
tasks~\cite{yosinski2014transferable}.
%%
This has led to successful application of such deep networks to various other
tasks in computer vision including the task of image captioning.
%%

In this thesis we will examine the task of automatic image and video captioning and
discuss algorithms utilizing tools from deep learning to solve this task.
%%
Much of the discussion presented in this thesis applies to both image and video
captioning problems.
%%
In such cases, in the interest of conciseness, we use the term ``visual
captioning'' to refer to both of these problems.
%%
Next, we will define the problem more precisely and list out the basic building
blocks of a visual captioning pipeline.

\section{Problem Statement}

\end{figure}

Our task is to generate a caption given an input image or video. 
%%
We are going to focus on methods to generate single sentence captions only. 
%%
Thus a caption can be precisely defined to be a sentence, $S$, which is a
sequence of words $(w_0, w_1,\cdots, w_{L-1})$ with $L$ being the length of the
sentence. 
%%
We are trying to learn the distribution, $P(S|V)$, where V is the visual
input (either an image or a video). 
%%
This can be written as 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:langB1} P(S|V) = P(w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{L-1}|V)  .
\end{equation}

In this work, the probability distribution, $P(S|V)$ is modeled using a two
staged approach, as has been popular in the image captioning literature. 
%%
In the first stage the visual input V is mapped onto one or more feature
vectors $V_f$.
%%
This process is deterministic and the feature vectors extracted are of fixed
size for every input. 
%%
In this thesis, we will explore different methods for extracting feature
vectors from images and videos and analyze their performance quantitatively and
qualitatively on the automatic captioning task. 

For images, we will experiment with features extracted from CNNs trained on
ImageNet for single image classification, explicit object detector features, and
features constructed from object localization networks.
%%
In the case of videos, we will explore dense trajectory features, frame-level
CNN features and 3D convolutional features. 

The next stage is the language model, which takes the visual feature vector
$V_f$ as input and learns a probability distribution over sentences.
%%
Since the sentences are sequence of words, they lend themselves naturally to be
modeled using sequential models such as recurrent neural networks.
%%
In this thesis we will only deal with language models based on the recurrent
networks, specifically a variant called Long-Short Term
Memory~(LSTM)~\cite{Hochreiter1997} networks.
%%
We will implement and analyze a popular implementation proposed in
literature~\cite{Vinyals_2015_CVPR}.
%%
Then we propose some extensions to this baseline language model by adding
additional input channels, using deeper networks with residual connections,
and class-based factorization of the language model. 
%%
We will also discuss several techniques to create an ensemble of language
models, exploring the problem of picking one best caption from a pool of
captions generated by each model in the ensemble.

Evaluating an image captioning system is also non-trivial, since we have to
compare the generated caption against a few different reference captions.
%%
The standard recipe followed in the literature, which we also use here, is to
use multiple automatic evaluation metrics adopted from the field of machine
translation research. 
%%
In addition, we present human evaluation results obtained by our participation
in two automatic video captioning challenges.
%%
Concretely, we participated in the Large Scale Movie Description
Challenge~(LSMDC) 2015 and the Microsoft Video to Text Challenge~(MSR-VTT) 2016
and the results from these competition will be presented here.
%%
Our video captioning models won both the competitions as judged by human
evaluators.

We analyze the results of the experiments qualitatively and discuss the
strengths and shortcomings of current solutions. 
%%
Drawing from this analysis, we finally discuss a few promising new directions the
research on vision and language is heading.

In summary, the main contributions of this thesis are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Discuss the basic caption generation pipeline in detail. 
  \item Propose use of alternative image and video features to improve the
          performance over the baseline model.
