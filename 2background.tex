\chapter{Background: Vision \& Language} \label{chapter:background} 
%%===========================================================================%%
In this chapter we will review some background literature exploring different
facets of integrating visual data and their natural language annotations.
%%
This includes learning good representations for images and videos, different
kinds of generative language models, techniques which attempt to rank similarity
between visual data and language annotations, and finally some recent advances
in captioning images and videos.
%%
Additionally, we will review some datasets available for training such captioning
models.

%%===========================================================================%%
\section{Visual Features}
%%----------------------------------%%
Visual media, be it image or video, are inherently very high-dimensional data.
%%
This large dimensionality poses a challenge for machine learning systems trying
to extract higher-level semantic information directly from such visual inputs,
as in case of captioning.
%%
To address this, images and videos have traditionally been represented with
smaller feature vectors which attempt to encode the most important information
present in them, while ignoring redundancies. 
%%
This feature extraction step is very important in any image understanding
pipeline as it usually serves as input to the subsequent modules and hence can
be a major bottleneck to the performance of the entire system.
%%
Therefore, we will now review some feature extraction techniques for images and
videos and identify the best performing ones, which will be used in designing
the captioning system later.

%=================================================================================
\subsection{Image Features}
Traditionally, tasks such as object recognition have relied on using
hand-crafted features to represent images. 
%%
Recently, however, deep Convolutional Neural Networks~(CNN), which learn to
extract features necessary for the task entirely from the data, have become a
popular choice for image feature extraction.
%%
This was triggered by the spectacular improvement in image classification
accuracy seen on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge~(ILSVRC)
2012, with the first use of CNNs in this competition.
%%
In this challenge, involving classifying the input images to one of thousand
classes, the submission by Krizhevsky \emph{et al}.\@~\cite{Krizhevsky2012}
using a deep CNN outperformed all the others by a large margin.
%%
This set off further exploration into CNN architectures and has driven up the
performance in the ImageNet classification task to even surpass the human
classification accuracies~\cite{he2015delving}.
%%

More interestingly, the deep CNNs trained on the large ImageNet dataset for
the classification task have been shown to generalize very well to other
datasets and tasks as well.
%%
In~\cite{yosinski2014transferable}, it is shown that the weights learnt by the
CNNs pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset are good initializers for other tasks
as well.
%%
That is, if we use the weights from CNNs pre-trained on ImageNet to initialize
the networks before training it on other datasets and tasks, we can learn much
better models than just using random initialization. 
%%
Alternatively, using activations from some higher layer of an ImageNet
pre-trained CNN as off-the-shelf image features has also been shown to produce
state-of-the-art results~\cite{Donahue2014, Razavian2014CVPR, ShettyACMMM2016,
ShettyACMMM2016Wrk} in several datasets and tasks, including object detection,
scene recognition, image and video captioning, etc.
%%
We will follow this second approach, i.e.\@ use activations from CNNs
pre-trained on ImageNet as feature input to our captioning model, without any
fine-tuning of the CNNs for this task.
%%
GoogLeNet~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/SzegedyLJSRAEVR14} and VGG~\cite{Simonyan14c}
architectures, which won the different categories of ILSVRC 2014 competition,
have been popular models for such feature extraction in the community with the
ready availability of the code and pre-trained models.

%=================================================================================
\subsection{Video Features}
Unlike in the case of images, where the convolutional neural network (CNN) image
features have become the \emph{de facto} standard features for many image
understanding related tasks, no single video feature extraction method has
achieved the best performance across tasks and datasets.
%%
Dense trajectories~\cite{DBLP:conf/cvpr/WangKSL11} and Improved dense
trajectories~\cite{Wang2013} have been popular video feature extraction methods
for the task of action recognition.
%%
In these methods, interest points are densely sampled in an initial frame
and then tracked across frames, to form trajectories.
%%
Furthermore, a set of local descriptors are extracted around the trajectory
coordinates to obtain a rich representation of the trajectory.
%%
These trajectories can encode motion patterns from a variety of sources, including
actions from agents in the video, camera motion, etc.
%%

Following the success of the deep CNN models on static images, there have been
attempts to train 3-D CNNs which operate directly on video
segments~\cite{3dCNN_ji2013, KarpathyCVPR14, DBLP:C3D}.
%%
However, these models need a lot of training data and are usually pre-trained on
some large action recognition dataset, e.g.\@ the Sports-1M
dataset~\cite{KarpathyCVPR14}.

All of the above features encode action-related information very well, but fail to
capture information about the identity of the objects in the video.
%%
The task of caption generation also requires us to describe the objects seen in
the video and their attributes, in addition to recognizing actions.
%%
This can be addressed by extracting features from individual
frames~\cite{venugopalan2015sequence} or key-frames~\cite{shetty2015video} using
CNNs pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.

In this work we explore both these paradigms of video feature extraction, namely
hand-crafted trajectory features and deep video features, for the task of
automatic visual captioning.

\section{Natural Language Modelling}
%%----------------------------------%%
Generative language models are widely used in various tasks including speech
recognition and synthesis, document analysis, dialog systems, etc.
%%
Our task of caption generation also involves learning a conditional generative
language model which can generate captions given the input visual features.
%%
For this purpose, we will now discuss a few different language modelling
approaches, and evaluate their suitability for our task.

The simple $n$-gram language models, which are based on counting co-occurrence
statistics of sequence of $n$ words, are surprisingly good baselines for a lot
of language modelling tasks.
%%
However, they are constrained to generate sentences only by using $n$-grams they
have seen in the training set.
%%
The maximum entropy language model~(ME-LM)~\cite{berger1996maximum} overcomes this
problem by using the principle of maximum entropy while learning the model.
%%
The principle dictates that among all the probabilistic models which satisfy the
constraints of the training data, one should pick the model which is the most
uniform.
%%
This allows the model to share some probability for unseen $n$-grams as well.

Both the above models suffer from using a short context of previous words when
predicting the next word, limited by the $n$-gram size, which can lead to longer
generated sentences being incoherent.
%%
Alternatively, one could use recurrent neural networks as generative language
models as proposed in~\cite{mikolov2010recurrent}.
%%
Recurrent neural networks have the benefit of having access to theoretically
infinite context through their hidden state.
%%
Additionally, these models do not need pre-defined language features, unlike in case
ME-LM, and can learn the necessary word representations from the data. 
%%
Indeed, such recurrent network based language models are quite popular in
the machine translation task~\cite{bahdanau2014neural}.

\section{Intermediate Problem: Multi-Modal \\Embeddings}
%%----------------------------------%%
A precursor to the problem of caption generation from input visual features, is
the problem of learning to map both visual features and the corresponding
natural language labels into a common semantic space.
%%
This was posed as a solution to automatically annotate images
in~\cite{weston2010large}.
%%
Here, using a simple bag-of-visual-words image representation, both the image
and words are projected into a common space, with the training objective of
ranking correctly the matching image and annotation pairs. 

In~\cite{frome2013devise}, using the CNN features as the image representation
and the word vectors from word2vec~\cite{mikolov2013distributed} embeddings as
the word representation, a linear embedding is learnt to map the image vectors
onto word vectors corresponding to the labels associated with the image.
%%
This allows the model to do ``zero-shot'' recognition of image classes it has
not seen before, by finding the nearest label to the embedded image feature.
%%
A much simpler approach is used in~\cite{norouzi2013zero}, where the mapping to
semantic embedding space is done by a convex combinations of $c$ word vectors
associated with the top $c$ classes identified in the image.
%%
This does away with the need to learn the embedding, while still achieving
impressive results in zero-shot classification on the ImageNet dataset.

The methods discussed above forms the basis for the way visual features are used
in captioning literature.
%%
In many early works, both image features and word vectors are input to the
Long-Short Term Memory~(LSTM) language model using the same input matrix,
forcing the model to learn a joint embedding for them.

%%----------------------------------%%
\section{Approaches to Visual Captioning}
%%----------------------------------%%
Visual captioning techniques include a wide range of methods and models.
%%
They can be broadly categorized into two groups: ones generating captions by
retrieving from a database~\cite{Farhadi2010, Hodosh2013,Karpathy2014},
and ones using natural language generation techniques to produce
captions~\cite{Li2011,kulkarni2013babytalk,Vinyals_2015_CVPR,Fang2015}.
%%
While the retrieval-based methods tend to be semantically more accurate as they
do not need to learn grammatical rules to generate a caption, the captions they
produce are strictly restricted to the caption database, and thus will not work
well on unseen data.
%%
In contrast, although generative models can learn to create novel captions and
even perform reasonably well on unseen data, they tend to have poorer semantic
accuracy and details.

Early work on captioning images presented in~\cite{Farhadi2010} was retrieval
based, wherein a similarity score between sentences and images is computed and
is used to retrieve the best matching caption to an input image. 
%%
This method relied on few hand-engineered image features and
dependency-parsing-based features for sentences.
%%
In ~\cite{Hodosh2013}, authors pose image description as a ranking problem
involving correctly ranking a set of captions by their relevance to the input
image.
%%
They argue that the ability to rank captions correctly is a good measure of
semantic image understanding, with the added benefit that it is much easier to
automatically evaluate such ranked lists than to evaluate generated novel
captions.
%%
Such retrieval-based system is further enhanced by the use of deep image
features and word embeddings in~\cite{Karpathy2014}.

One of the early models to successfully generate novel image captions was
described~\cite{kulkarni2013babytalk}, albeit relying on pre-defined sentence
templates to generate captions.
%%
In ~\cite{Li2011}, this template based language model is replaced with a
$n$-gram based one learnt from large-scale natural language data collected from
the web.

Following the successful use of recurrent network--based language models on
tasks such as automatic speech recognition~\cite{mikolov2010recurrent} and
machine translation~\cite{bahdanau2014neural}, this approach was quickly adapted
to the image captioning literature as well~\cite{Karpathy_2015_CVPR,
Vinyals_2015_CVPR, donahue2015long}.
%%
All these methods consist of two-stage encoder--decoder models, with the encoder
being the image feature extraction module and the decoder being the recurrent
language model.
%%
One major advantage of this approach is that it allows end-to-end training of the
entire system.
%%
In the case of ~\cite{Karpathy_2015_CVPR}, CNN-based image features and a simple
recurrent neural network~(RNN) based language model are used as the encoder and
the decoder, respectively.
%%
The authors also propose techniques to align different parts of a caption to
different regions in the image. 
%%
Similarly in~\cite{Vinyals_2015_CVPR}, authors also use CNN image features, but
an LSTM-based network is used for the language model.
%%
In their method, the image features are fed to the LSTM only at the beginning of
the recursion, in order to prevent the network from over-fitting.
%%
Starting from a similar CNN+LSTM based pipeline,\cite{donahue2015long} proposes
a more general framework which can generate captions for both images and videos.
%%
In the case of videos, they replace the single image CNN feature with a sequence
of conditional random field~(CRF) video features and keep the language model
configuration identical.

As opposed to such end-to-end learning systems, \cite{Fang2015} takes a modular
approach. 
%%
They first train a set of object or concept detectors using multiple instance
learning~\cite{maron1998framework}.
%%
Then, a maximum entropy language model takes these detector outputs as input to
generate the candidate sentence.
%%
This concept detector--based approach has been applied also to video captioning
in~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/RohrbachTRTPLCS16}, where the authors train a
``visual label'' detector on the LSMDC dataset and use it as an input to an LSTM
language model.

In \cite{Xu2015show}, instead of using a single image feature vector from a
fully connected CNN layer, multiple local image features extracted from a lower
layer in the CNN are used.
%%
Then an attention mechanism is proposed to choose the right image features to
look at while generating different words in the caption.
%%
Similar attention mechanism is used in~\cite{you2016image}, but instead of using
the attention model to pick local CNN features, it is used to pick the right
semantic concept, from the output of a semantic concept detector.

Attention models extended to temporal domain have been applied to the video
captioning task, in order to dynamically choose the right video feature
~\cite{yao2015describing}.
%
Alternatively, a recurrent network is used to encode frame-level video features
before inputting them to the language model in~\cite{venugopalan2015sequence}.
%%
Then a standard LSTM language model is used to decode these features into a
caption.
%%
\section{Datasets for Image and Video Captioning}
%%===========================================================================%%
The rapid progress in automatic image and video captioning in the recent years
has also been driven by the availability of large-scale datasets to train and
test such models on. 
%%
These captioning datasets have images or videos with one or more associated
reference captions.
%%
The reference captions can be collected with large-scale human annotation using
crowd sourcing tools such as Amazon Mechanical Turk or they can be mined from
other related sources.

One of the early datasets for image captioning was 
Pascal1K~\cite{Rashtchian2010} consisting of 1000 images five human-annotated
captions for each of them.
%%
Flickr8k~\cite{Hodosh2013} and Flickr30k~\cite{Young2014} are relatively much
larger datasets, consisting of 8,000 and 30,000 images, respectively. 
%%
They also have five human-written captions for each image.
%%
Currently, the most popular and largest dataset for image captioning is the
Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) collection~\cite{Lin2014} with over
200,000 images and at least five human-written captions per image.
%%
There exists also an associated MS-COCO evaluation server, where researchers can
upload their captions on the blind test dataset and compare the performance of
their system to the state-of-the-art methods on a public leaderboard.
%%
Due to its size and availability of a standardized benchmark, all the image
captioning experiments reported in this thesis are conducted on the MS-COCO
dataset. 
%%

Video captioning datasets are more difficult to collect and we can consequently
see both automatic caption mining techniques and manual annotation used to
collect them.
%%
YouTube corpus~\cite{chen2011collecting} consists of 2000 video clips with
at least 27 textual descriptions for each video.
%%
The M-VAD~\cite{rohrbach15cvpr} and MPII-MD~\cite{AtorabiM-VAD2015} datasets
used in the first Large Scale Movie Description Challenge~(LSMDC), were
collected by extracting movie clips and transcribing the associated audio
descriptions available in the movie DVDs.
%%
In total the LSMDC dataset contains about ~100k clips from 202 movies and one
reference caption associated with each clip. 
%%
Creators of this dataset also provide an evaluation server to standardize the
testing and comparison of performance on it.
%%
More recently released Microsoft Video to Text dataset~(MSR-VTT) contains 10,000
short videos with 20 human annotated captions for each of them. 
%%
This makes it the largest video captioning dataset in terms of video--caption
pairs.
%%
The MSR-VTT dataset was also used in the recently concluded MSR-VTT video captioning
challenge.

%%
We conduct our video captioning experiments on both the LSMDC and MSR-VTT
datasets and also report results from our participation of the video captioning
challenges associated with these datasets.
