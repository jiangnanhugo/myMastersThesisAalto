\chapter{Background: Vision \& Language} \label{chapter:background} 
%%===========================================================================%%
In this chapter we will review some background literature exploring different
facets of integrating visual data and natural language annotations of them.
%%
This includes learning good representations for images and videos, different
kinds of generative language models, techniques which attempt to rank similarity
between visual data and language annotations, and finally some recent advances
in captioning images and videos.
%%
Additionally, we will review some datasets available for training such captioning
models.

%%===========================================================================%%
\section{Visual features}
%%----------------------------------%%
Visual media, be it image or video, are inherently very high-dimensional data.
%%
This large dimensionality poses a challenge for machine learning systems trying
to extract higher level semantic information directly from such visual inputs,
such as in case of captioning.
%%
To address this, images and videos have been traditionally represented with
smaller feature vectors which attempt to encode the most important information
present in them, while ignoring redundancies. 
%%
This feature extraction step is very important in any image understanding
pipeline as it usually serves as input to subsequent modules and thus can be a
major bottleneck to the performance of the entire system.
%%
Thus, we will now review some feature extraction techniques for images and
videos and identify the best performing ones, which will be used in
designing our captioning system later.

%=================================================================================
\subsection{Image Features}
Traditionally, tasks like object recognition have relied on using
hand-engineered features to represent images. 
%%
But recently deep Convolutional Neural Networks~(CNN), which learn to extract
features necessary for the task entirely from the data, have become a popular
choice for image feature extraction.
%%
This was triggered by the spectacular improvement in image classification
accuracy seen on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge~(ILSVRC)
2012, with the first use of CNNs in this challenge.
%%
In this challenge involving classifying the input images to one of thousand
classes, the submission by~\cite{Krizhevsky2012} using a deep CNN outperformed
all the other submission by a large margin.
%%
This set-off further exploration into CNN architectures and has driven up the
performance in the ImageNet classification task to even surpass human
performance~\cite{he2015delving}.
%%

More interestingly, these deep CNNs trained on the large ImageNet dataset for
the classification task have been shown to generalize very well to other
datasets and tasks as well.
%%
In~\cite{yosinski2014transferable}, it is shown that using the weights from the
CNNs pre-trained on ImageNet as initialization when using similar CNNs for other
datasets and tasks help learn significantly better models.
%%
Alternatively, even using activations from a higher layer of a ImageNet
pre-trained CNN as off-the shelf image features is also shown to produce
state-of-the art results~\cite{Donahue2014,Razavian2014CVPR} in several datasets
and tasks, including object detection, scene recognition etc.
%%
We will use this second approach, i.e.\@ use activations from CNNs pre-trained
on ImageNet as feature input to our captioning model, without any fine-tuning of
the CNNs for this task.
%%
GoogleLeNet~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/SzegedyLJSRAEVR14} and
VGG~\cite{Simonyan14c} architectures, which won the different categories of
ILSVRC 2014 competition, have been popular source of such feature extraction in
the community with the ready availability of the code and pre-trained models.

%=================================================================================
\subsection{Video Features}
Unlike in the case of images, where the convolutional neural network (CNN) image
features have become the \emph{de facto} standard features for many image
understanding related tasks, no single video feature extraction method has
achieved the best performance across tasks and datasets.
%%
Dense trajectories~\cite{DBLP:conf/cvpr/WangKSL11} and Improved dense
trajectories~\cite{Wang2013} have been popular video feature extraction methods
for the task of action recognition.
%%
In these methods, some interest points are densely sampled in an initial frame
and then tracked across frames, to form trajectories.
%%
Furthermore, a set of local descriptors are extracted around the trajectory
co-ordinates to obtain a rich representation of the trajectory.
%%
These trajectories can encode motion patterns from variety of sources, including
actions from agents in the video, camera motion etc.
%%

Following the success of deep CNN models on static images, there have been
attempts to train 3-D CNNs which operate directly on video
segments~\cite{3dCNN_ji2013, KarpathyCVPR14, DBLP:C3D}.
%%
However, these models need a lot of training data and are usually pre-trained on
some large action recognition dataset, e.g.\@ the Sports-1M
dataset~\cite{KarpathyCVPR14}.

All of the above features encode action related information very well but fail to
capture the information about identity of the objects in the video.
%%
The task of caption generation also requires us to describe the objects seen in
the video and their attributes, in addition to recognizing actions.
%%
This can be addressed by extracting features from individual
frames~\cite{venugopalan2015sequence} or key-frames~\cite{shetty2015video} using
CNNs pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.

In this work we explore both these paradigms of video feature extraction and
both hand-engineered trajectory features and deep video features for the task of
automatic captioning.

\section{Natural Language Modelling}
%%----------------------------------%%
Generative language models are widely used in various tasks including speech
recognition and synthesis, document analysis, dialog systems etc.
%%
Our task of caption generation also involves learning a conditional generative
language model which can generate captions given the input visual feature.
%%
For this purpose, we will now discuss a few different language modelling
approaches, and discuss their suitability for our task.

The simple N-gram language models, which are based on counting co-occurrence
statistics of sequence of n-words, are surprisingly good baselines for a lot of
language modelling tasks.
%%
But they are constrained to generate sentences only using n-grams it has seen in
the training set.
%%
Maximum entropy language model~\cite{berger1996maximum}(ME-LM) overcomes this
problem by using the principle of maximum entropy while learning the model.
%%
The principle of maximum entropy dictates that among all the probabilistic
models which satisfy the constraints of the training data, one should pick the
model which is the most uniform.
%%
Thus it allows the model to share some probability for unseen n-grams as well.

But both the above models suffer from having to use a short context of previous
words when predicting the next word, limited by the n-gram size, which can lead
to longer generated sentences being in-coherent.
%%
Alternatively, one could use recurrent neural networks as generative language
models as proposed in~\cite{mikolov2010recurrent}.
%%
Recurrent neural networks have the benefit of having access to infinite context
through its hidden state.
%%
Additionally, these models do not need pre-defined language features, unlike in case
ME-LM, and can learn the necessary word representations from the data. 
%%
Indeed, such recurrent network based language models are quite popular in
machine translation task~\cite{bahdanau2014neural}

\section{Intermediate Problem: Multi-Modal \\Embeddings}
%%----------------------------------%%
A precursor to the problem of caption generation from input visual features, is
the problem of learning to map both visual features and the
corresponding natural language labels into a common semantic space.
%%
This was posed as a solution to automatically annotate images
in~\ref{weston2010large}.
%%
Here, using a simple bag-of-visual words image representation, both image and
words are projected into a common space, with training objective of ranking
correctly the matching image and annotation pairs. 

In~\cite{frome2013devise}, using CNN features as image representations and
word vectors from word2vec~\cite{mikolov2013distributed} embeddings as word
representation, a linear embedding is learnt to map the image vectors onto
word vectors corresponding to the labels associated with the image.
%%
This allows the model to do ``zero-shot'' recognition on image classes it has
not seen before, by finding the nearest label to the embedded image feature.
%%
A much simpler approach is used in~\cite{norouzi2013zero}, where the mapping to
semantic embedding space is done by a convex combinations of $n$ word vectors
associated with top $n$ classes identified on the image.
%%
This does away with the need to learn the embedding, while still achieving
impressive results in zero-shot classification on ImageNet dataset

This literature forms the basis for the way visual features are used in
captioning literature.
%%
In many early works, both image features and word vectors are input to the LSTM
language model using the same input matrix, forcing the model to learn a common
joint embedding for them.

%%----------------------------------%%
\section{Approaches to Visual Captioning}
%%----------------------------------%%
Visual captioning techniques include a wide range of methods and models.
%%
They can be broadly categorized into two groups: ones generating captions by
retrieving from a database~\cite{Farhadi2010, Hodosh2013,Karpathy2014},
and ones using natural language generation techniques to produce
captions~\cite{Li2011,kulkarni2013babytalk,Vinyals_2015_CVPR,Fang2015}.
%%
While the retrieval based methods tend to be semantically more accurate as they
do not need to learn grammatical rules to generate a caption, the captions they
produce are strictly restricted to the caption database, and thus won't work
well on unseen data.
%%
In contrast, although generative models can learn to create novel captions and even
perform reasonably well on unseen data, they tend to have poorer semantic
accuracy and details.

Early work on captioning images presented in~\cite{Farhadi2010} was retrieval
based, wherein a similarity score between sentences and images is computed and
is used to retrieve the best matching caption to an input image. 
%%
This method relied on few hand engineered image features and dependency parsing
based features for sentences.
%%
In ~\cite{Hodosh2013}, authors pose the image description as a ranking problem
involving correctly ranking a set of captions by their relevance to the input
image.
%%
They argue that, ability to rank the captions correctly is a good measure of
semantic image understanding, with the added benifit that it is much easier to
automatically evaluate such ranked lists than evaluating generated novel
captions.
%%
Such retrieval based system is further enhanced by use of deep image feature and
word embeddings in~\cite{Karpathy2014}.

One of the early models to successfully generate novel image captions was
described~\cite{kulkarni2013babytalk}, albeit relying on pre-defined sentence
templates to generate captions.
%%
In ~\cite{Li2011}, this template based language model is replaced with a n-gram
based one learnt from large scale natural language data from the web.

Following the successful use of recurrent network based language models on
tasks like automatic speech recognition~\cite{mikolov2010recurrent} and machine
translation~\cite{bahdanau2014neural}, it was quickly adapted to the image
captioning literature as well~\cite{Karpathy_2015_CVPR, Vinyals_2015_CVPR,
donahue2015long}.
%%
All these methods consists of two-stage encoder--decoder models, with 
encoder being the image feature extraction module and decoder being the
recurrent language model.
%%
One major advantage of this approach is it allows end to end training of the
entire system.
%%
In case of ~\cite{Karpathy_2015_CVPR}, CNN based image features and a simple
recurrent neural network~(RNN) based language model are used as encoder and
decoder respectively.
%%
The authors also propose techniques to align different parts of a caption to
different regions in the image. 
%%
Similarly in~\cite{Vinyals_2015_CVPR}, authors also use CNN image features, but
an LSTM based network is used for the language model.
%%
In their method, the image features are fed to the LSTM only at the beginning of
the recursion, in order to prevent the network from over-fitting.
%%
Starting from a similar CNN+LSTM based pipeline,\cite{donahue2015long} propose a
more general framework which can generate captions for videos.
%%
In case of videos, they replace the single image CNN feature with a sequence of
conditional random field (CRF) video features and keep the language model
configuration same.

As opposed to such end-to-end learning systems, \cite{Fang2015} takes a modular
approach. 
%%
They first train a set of object or concept detectors using multiple instance
learning. 
%%
Then, a maximum entropy language model takes these detector outputs as input to
generate the candidate sentence.
%%
This concept detector based approach has been also applied to video captioning
in~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/RohrbachTRTPLCS16}, where the authors train a
"visual label" detector on the LSMDC dataset and use it as an input to a LSTM
language model.

In \cite{Xu2015show}, instead of using a single image feature vector from a
fully connected layer, multiple local image features from a lower layer in the
CNN is used.
%%
Then an attention mechanism is proposed to choose the right image features to
look at while generating different words in the caption.
%%
Similar attention mechanism is used in~\cite{you2016image}, but instead of using
the attention model to pick local CNN features, it is used to pick the right
semantic concept, from the output of a semantic concept detector.

Attention models extended to temporal domain have been applied to video
captioning task, in-order to dynamically choose the right video feature
in~\cite{yao2015describing}.
%
Alternatively, a recurrent network is used to encode frame-level video features
before inputting them to the language model in~\cite{venugopalan2015sequence}.
%%
Then a standard LSTM language model is used to decode these features into a
caption.
%%
\section{Datasets for Image and Video Captioning}
%%===========================================================================%%
The rapid progress in image and video captioning in the recent years has also been
driven by the availability of large scale datasets to train and test such models
on. 
%%
These captioning datasets have images/videos with one or more associated
reference caption.
%%
The reference captions can be collected by large-scale human annotation using
crowd sourcing tools Amazon Mechanical Turk or it could be mined from other
related sources. 

One of the early datasets for image captioning was the
Pascal1K~\cite{Rashtchian2010} consisting of 1000 images five human annotated
captions for each of them.
%%
Flickr8k~\cite{Hodosh2013} and Flickr30k~\cite{Young2014} are relatively much
larger data sets, consisting of 8,000 images and 30,000 images, respectively. 
%%
They also have five human-written captions for each image.
%%
Currently, the most popular and largest dataset for image captioning, is the
Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO)~\cite{Lin2014} with over 200,000
images and at least five human-written captions per image.
%%
There exists also an associated MS-COCO evaluation server, where researchers can
upload their captions on the blind test dataset and compare the performance of
their system to the state-of-the-art methods on a public leaderboard.
%%
Due to its size and availability of standardized benchmark, we choose to conduct
all our image captioning experiments on the MS-COCO dataset. 
%%

Video captioning datasets are more difficult to collect and thus we see 
use of both automatic caption mining techniques and manual annotation used to
collect them.
%%
YouTube corpus~\cite{chen2011collecting} consists of 2000 video clips with
at least 27 descriptions for each video.
%%
The M-VAD~\cite{rohrbach15cvpr} and MPII-MD~\cite{AtorabiM-VAD2015}
datasets used in the first Large Scale Movie Description Challenge~(LSMDC), were
collected using by using movie clips and transcribing associated audio
description available in the movie DVDs.
%%
In total the dataset contains about ~100k clips from 202 movies and one
reference caption associated with each clip. 
%%
This dataset is also associated with an evaluation server in-order to
standardize the testing and comparison of performance on it.
%%
More recently released Microsoft Video to Text dataset~(MSR-VTT) contains 10,000
with 20 human annotated captions for each of them. 
%%
This makes it the largest video captioning dataset in terms of video-caption
pairs.
%%
MSR-VTT dataset was also used in the recently concluded MSR-VTT video captioning
challenge.

%%
We conduct our video captioning experiments on both the LSMDC and the MSR-VTT
datasets and also report results from our participation of the video captioning
challenges associated with these datasets.
